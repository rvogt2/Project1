The following is a deliverable for the first project for a coding bootcamp I am a part of. Prompt is open-ended

Though it has very little logic, It has anchor links that link to other HTML pages that share the same styling, and use the same version of Bootstrap

Standards used for the project are HTML5, CSS, JS(though very minimal), and Bootstrap(also minimal due to lack of practice using it)

At current time, the couple of ways to improve this site:
- Saving the data and allowing quick searching up of the characters used or sent in via the form input.
- Improved style, easily.
- and permitting using an image as a field for the data entry form.
